//Proposal:
Privacy

How does the day-to-day use of technology affect our privacy? 

The rapid evolution of technology has done wonderful things for society, but how much about us are we unknowingly giving away with our daily use of these beloved devices?

Why this is relevant? The issue of privacy is a divisive topic which is constantly discussed and argued amongst the populous, with security issues, leaks, spying, tracking, and much more constantly on global headlines. 


In our investigation of this topic we look to cover: 

-	How our information is collected
-	Why our information is collected
-	What information is being collected and used
-	What this information is used for, whether that’s good or bad
-	How much information are we giving away when we: 
o	Surf the web / use the internet
o	Use our daily devices such a desktops, laptops, phones, etc
o	Interact with technology in general (smart devices, other people’s devices, etc)
-	What are the negatives / positives of our information being used?
-	What information is being taken and used without our knowledge?
-	How can legislations and regulations impact our privacy?
-	Virtual Private Networks, and their effect on privacy
-	How our information informs the way we use / view technology
-	Significant events in the world that effected privacy
-	New Zealand’s stance on privacy
