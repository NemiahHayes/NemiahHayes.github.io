  <h2>A Study on Privacy</h2> 
  <h3>How does the day-to-day use of technology affect our privacy? </h3>
  <br>
  <h4>Prologue.</h4>
  <p>
    Society has come to largely rely on the use of modern devices to the point of them being near essential for daily living, 
    getting by without using a modern smart device has become near impossible. This has given power to information greater than 
    any other time in history, large companies now have easier and more access to our data and also can profit off of it easier and
     more than they ever have before. We believe that this made calls for a look into an understanding of privacy and information, 
     for we feel that it’s not okay for large corporations to entirely abuse their privileges and entrench our information in the way 
     that they do. For this project, we investigated how these companies gather our data, what data they’re gathering, and the outcomes 
     and implications that may arise from their data-gathering methods. We found this all to be important, as having this information allowed 
     us to come to a sound, educated, and relatively objective conclusion on our moral and ethical standpoints around the subject.
