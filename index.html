  <h2>A Study on Privacy</h2> 
  <h3>How does the day-to-day use of technology affect our privacy? </h3>
  <br>
  <h4>Prologue</h4>
  <p>
    Society has come to largely rely on the use of modern devices to the point of them being near essential for daily living, 
    getting by without using a modern smart device has become near impossible. This has given the power to information greater 
    than any other time in history, large companies now have easier and more access to our data and also can profit off of it 
    easier and more than they ever have before. We believe that this made calls for a look into an understanding of privacy and 
    information, for we feel that it’s not okay for large corporations to entirely abuse their privileges and entrench our information 
    in the way that they do. For this project, we investigated how these companies gather our data, what data they’re gathering, 
    and the outcomes and implications that may arise from their data-gathering methods. We found this all to be important, as having 
    this information allowed us to come to a sound, educated, and relatively objective conclusion on our moral and ethical standpoints 
    around the subject. 
  </p>
  <h4>Opportunities and Society</h4>
  <p>
    Privacy has been a concern of large contention throughout the last decade, with data leaks and 
    information invasiveness scandals constantly on the headlines. It’s well known that even the 
    United States government in particular amasses a vast amount of data that should otherwise be 
    personal and private<a href="bibli.htlm">[1]</a>. The argument is made that a person who has nothing to hide shouldn’t 
    care about the invasiveness of these companies, but that’s a very surface-level notion that I 
    believe doesn’t take a proper, critical look at the larger picture. I’m sure we all enjoy our 
    shower curtains, and I’m sure we’d all feel uncomfortable with a camera and microphone shoved 
    in our face while we eat, sleep and breathe all day. And I’m sure we’d appreciate it if companies 
    simply let us know what and when they’re gathering our information, and what it’s used for. 
    Unfortunately, a majority of people who deal with data, aren’t very interested in the moral and 
    ethical implications that this data-gathering concerns. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Privacy has turned into such a great concern that many countries have had to enact laws and regulations
    in order to protect the population’s data privacy. A famous example is Europe’s GDPR (General Data 
    Protection Regulations), which has aided in regulating the use of data tracking and gathering of 
    personal information. This regulation made it so that companies operating within the EU are 
    obligated to take measures in letting users know when their information is being tracked and for their 
    permission before using these websites, they’re also obligated to let you know if a large data breach 
    has occurred, among many other regulations.
    <br>
    <br>
    In New Zealand, large companies that regularly operate in Europe have to follow these guidelines,
    however, companies that operate within New Zealand follow a different set of rules<a href="biblio.html">[2]</a> under the
    Privacy Act<a href="biblio.html">[3]</a>. This act is similar to Europe’s GDPR in that you have to state when and what 
    information you’re gathering, and that you only gather what’s needed. This privacy act applies to 
    the Government, Companies, Small businesses, Social clubs and any other type of organisation. On 
    top of this, the act applies different rules and regulations for certain information. Organisations 
    which hold information on credit, health, civil defence, telecommunications, superannuation, or the 
    justice sector all fall under different regulations to uphold as opposed to organisations which hold 
    more typical information like interests and browsing history.
