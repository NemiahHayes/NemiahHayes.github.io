    <h2>A Study on Privacy</h2> 
    <h3>How does the day-to-day use of technology affect our privacy? </h3>
    <p>
      Modern Society has come to largely rely on the use of modern devices, getting by without the use of a
      smart phone and internet connection has become extremely difficult if not impossible. This has given more
      power to information, and more access to that information than ever before. This project looks at how they're
      gathering this information, social media / big corporations play in this, etc. --- WIP ---
    </p>
    <h3>How is our information gathered?</h3>
    <h4>Cookies</h4> 
    <p>
    Cookies are how information is stored locally on your computer. They're sent and received by the 
    website's server, and store things like login information, shopping carts, etc. Another thing it's 
    useful for is collecting information on how a consumer may behave or interact with a website. 
    </p>
    <h4>Browser Fingerprinting</h4>
    <p>
    Browser fingerprinting is a method which essentially ID's your computer hardware or browser, and uses 
    that information to identify you and track your information. This is how a large majority of websites 
    personalize information and advertisements that they send to you. Fingerprinting while in the past was 
    usually done with cookies, can also be done with HTML code.

    Information gathering can also be done through your browser history, scripts, and even questionnaires 
    and social media use.
