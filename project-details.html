    <h3>How is our data being gathered?</h3>
    <p>
      Before investigating further we wanted to take a peek at how the inner workings of data gathering really worked. An article from Master’s 
      in Data Science (Master’s in Data Science, 2020)<a href="biblio.html">[2]</a> expresses that a majority of data tracking comes from things like cookies, and device 
      fingerprinting, or smaller methods like scripts, browsing history analysis, and even direct forms like questionnaires and surveys. While 
      popular methods such as cookies allow you, for the most part, to block them, a lot of these methods actually go unnoticed and will 
      only be mentioned in things privacy policies and terms of use- contracts that are long and so filled with layman denying language that 
      they’re barely ever read. That’s also assuming that they’re even mentioned at all. 
    </p>
    <h4>Cookies</h4> 
    <p>
      Cookies are easily the most well-known and popular method for information gathering. They’re a (usually) small file that’s locally stored on your device,
       it tends to contain data like your login info, browsing behaviours, and website settings. Without cookies, this information would usually get lost after 
       you left the page, however, with cookies, the information is stored until the cookie is cleared or deleted. The original creator had actually created cookies
        to be used with a website store. He wanted users to be able to store items in a shopping cart, leave the website, and have the shopping cart still contain 
        all the items that they had left there previously. 
    <br>
    <br>
      While with normal use cookies are completely fine and only serve to improve the user experience, it’s in their abuse of them that they become dangerous. 
      If we go back to how cookies are used, they’re locally stored files on your computer which are sent back and forth between your hard drive and the website’s
      server. When they’re called to the server they’re usually stored on those drives. So any information that is being put inside those cookie files can be 
      accessed by anyone on the server-side of things meaning they can essentially do what they like with that cookie file. This has become a large problem in recent
      times as advertisers and marketing companies, in particular, are always looking to profit off of user information. When you have a file that’s as accessible 
      and powerful as a cookie file it becomes very easy to look at something like browsing activities and gather someone’s interests and behaviours in order to cater
      your marketing to them. 

    </p>
    <h4>Browser Fingerprinting</h4>
    <p>
      Device fingerprinting is a method that looks at your device’s unique ID and tracks your activities and information by semi-accurately knowing what device is performing
       what activity. Fingerprinting usually uses javascript to look at unique identifiers such as your OS, browser, hardware, device, and even IP to figure out if the user
        is a repeat or new visitor. While this method doesn’t prove to be as accurate as cookies, unlike cookies, this technique is done server-side and doesn’t require a 
        file to be locally stored on your device<a href="biblio.html">[3]</a>. Device fingerprinting methods are able to track and gather your data without even your web browser being able to detect it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As your data is collected and stored this creates a device hash<a href="biblio.html">[4]</a>. These device hashes are used to identify your device, generally, complex fingerprinting systems 
      will use multiple hashes in order to identify you. Generally, this information can be used on the developer end in order to aid them with cyber-security problems. 
      For example, if a fraudulent user were to make purchases with a set of stolen credit cards, device fingerprinting would aid a company in catching that fraudulent user.
       As activities are tracked their systems are able to discern whether something is suspicious, those activities are logged and then sent to fraud managers, who may 
       investigate the activity. 
       <br>
       <br>
      A problem with data arises particularly with device fingerprinting, however. In Europe, there is a particular regulation concerning privacy called the “General Data
       Protection Regulations”<a href="biblio.html">[5]</a>. While this regulation requires that websites ask for permission to use the aforementioned cookies, the law is a bit more ambiguous 
       when it comes to device fingerprinting. There’s no law that explicitly states that they have to ask permission in order to enforce device fingerprinting, they do,
        however, have to be transparent in what data they’re gathering if they plan on using device fingerprinting to potentially gather any personal information<a href="biblio.html">[6]</a>.
