    <h3>How is our data being gathered?</h3>
    <p>
      Before investigating further we wanted to take a peek at how the inner workings of data gathering really worked. An article from Master’s
      in Data Science (Master’s in Data Science, 2020)<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a> expresses that a majority of data tracking comes from things like cookies, and device
      fingerprinting, or smaller methods like scripts, browsing history analysis, and even direct forms like questionnaires and surveys. While
      popular methods such as cookies allow you, for the most part, to block them, a lot of these methods actually go unnoticed and will
      only be mentioned in things privacy policies and terms of use- contracts that are long and so filled with layman denying language that
      they’re barely ever read. That’s also assuming that they’re even mentioned at all.
    </p>
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      Cookies are easily the most well-known and popular method for information gathering. They’re a (usually) small file that’s locally stored on your device,
       it tends to contain data like your login info, browsing behaviours, and website settings. Without cookies, this information would usually get lost after
       you left the page, however, with cookies, the information is stored until the cookie is cleared or deleted. The original creator had actually created cookies
        to be used with a website store. He wanted users to be able to store items in a shopping cart, leave the website, and have the shopping cart still contain
        all the items that they had left there previously.
    <br>
    <br>
      While with normal use cookies are completely fine and only serve to improve the user experience, it’s in their abuse of them that they become dangerous.
      If we go back to how cookies are used, they’re locally stored files on your computer which are sent back and forth between your hard drive and the website’s
      server. When they’re called to the server they’re usually stored on those drives. So any information that is being put inside those cookie files can be
      accessed by anyone on the server-side of things meaning they can essentially do what they like with that cookie file. This has become a large problem in recent
      times as advertisers and marketing companies, in particular, are always looking to profit off of user information. When you have a file that’s as accessible
      and powerful as a cookie file it becomes very easy to look at something like browsing activities and gather someone’s interests and behaviours in order to cater
      your marketing to them.

    </p>
    <h4>Browser Fingerprinting</h4>
    <p>
      Device fingerprinting is a method that looks at your device’s unique ID and tracks your activities and information by semi-accurately knowing what device is performing
       what activity. Fingerprinting usually uses javascript to look at unique identifiers such as your OS, browser, hardware, device, and even IP to figure out if the user
        is a repeat or new visitor. While this method doesn’t prove to be as accurate as cookies, unlike cookies, this technique is done server-side and doesn’t require a
        file to be locally stored on your device<a href="biblio.html">[2]</a>. Device fingerprinting methods are able to track and gather your data without even your web browser being able to detect it.
      <br>
      <br>
      As your data is collected and stored this creates a device hash<a href="biblio.html">[3]</a>. These device hashes are used to identify your device, generally, complex fingerprinting systems
      will use multiple hashes in order to identify you. Generally, this information can be used on the developer end in order to aid them with cyber-security problems.
      For example, if a fraudulent user were to make purchases with a set of stolen credit cards, device fingerprinting would aid a company in catching that fraudulent user.
       As activities are tracked their systems are able to discern whether something is suspicious, those activities are logged and then sent to fraud managers, who may
       investigate the activity.
       <br>
       <br>
      A problem with data arises particularly with device fingerprinting, however. In Europe, there is a particular regulation concerning privacy called the “General Data
       Protection Regulations”<a href="biblio.html">[4]</a>. While this regulation requires that websites ask for permission to use the aforementioned cookies, the law is a bit more ambiguous
       when it comes to device fingerprinting. There’s no law that explicitly states that they have to ask permission in order to enforce device fingerprinting, they do,
      however, have to be transparent in what data they’re gathering if they plan on using device fingerprinting to potentially gather any personal information<a href="biblio.html">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
      <h2>Choices & Risks</h2>
      <h4> Profiles & Algorithms </h4>
    <p>
      In contrast to a demographic profile which consists of factual content collected on a person such as their age, sex, race, career etc.
      Psychographics is a study that aims to probe at why a person thinks the way they do, with the various techniques (cookies/fingerprinting etc.)
      used by large companies to gather and compile mass amounts of personal data scoured from across the internet, with individuals opinions, (digital) activities and interests/hobbies,
      this information is then compiled into a psychographic profile of sorts to gather an idea of things such as personal values & behaviors, among the
      most enticing to corporations being the person’s consumer values alongside other factors that may influence their purchasing decisions.
      One example of this process can be seen through how Facebook collects information from the countless accounts on the platform to sell to advertisers.
      “FB uses this data, together with information from other sources, including face recognition, to assemble huge stores of personal information,
      including location, travel history, financial status, mood, love life, and interests, all of which is useful for advertisers, who provide almost all of FB’s revenue.”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      Computer-constructed personas, i.e. psychographic profiles of people, are created for marketers/media platforms to utilize so they can cater personalized
      content to people or deduce what products the targeted users would be more enticed towards buying. Using complex machine learning alongside the aforementioned data analysis & gathering process,
      media platforms/corporations use complex algorithms to cater content to users that the algorithms have deducted to be something the user in question would have an interest in.
      One example of these algorithms in function can be seen in the platforms Youtube and Tiktok which use them to finetune the videos they push to your recommended feed depending on factors
      like what you've watched previously or other information you may have unknowingly given them through your online activity (games played, websites visited etc.),
      another more specific example of this could be a dog lover/owner who would see more dog related products in advertisements or dog related videos while browsing,
      versus a cat lover/owner who would have the exact opposite browsing experience. Information on these 2 theoretical people would be disturbingly easy for corporations to gather through their online presence,
      such as: photos of the pet on social media, location tracking that would give insight into things like habits (walking their dog every morning/evening) or places they visit (vets, pet stores etc.).
    </p>

       <h4> Digital Forensics </h4>
    <p>
      Modern society is largely reliant on devices to connect and communicate with the wider world, the normalization of always being perpetually online and the data each individual leaves behind on the internet
      has resulted in a whole new world of information being opened up. The internet and the limitless surveilled data that flows through it gives the law a new avenue to scour for digital evidence of crime (be it cyber or not) through people's digital footprints.
      Digital or computer forensics is a field that capitalizes on this and aims to gather evidence and ultimately solve crime in the virtual world, in more practical aspects the purpose of a digital forensics investigator mainly focuses on the recovery of data.
      There are usually one of two purposes for this, the first being to recover lost/corrupted data for companies that have had data leaks happen to them and the second being the recovery of incriminating data that suspects may have attempted to get rid of,
      since such a large portion of a person's details can be seen through online data gathered on them, a common place to look for incriminating information on suspects nowadays is through their personal devices, the data that investigators are typically on
      the lookout for to put towards case evidence can include things like: “documents, browsing information or even metadata, may then be used by prosecution to create a compelling case against the suspect.”<a href="biblio.html">[13]</a>
    </p>

      <h4> Social Media's Normalization & Immortalization </h4>
    <p>
      With the meteoric rise of social media from the days of MySpace and early Facebook in 2003~2004 to current day giants like Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter, it's become almost impossible to find anyone who hasn't delved into at least one of these platforms.
      The explosive normalization of social media began in the early 2000s with the evolution of social networking platforms from simple text-to-text conversations to photo sharing (facebook, twitter) and video sharing (youtube) and is now considered an integral part of social life,
      from school life to the workplace. With the standardization of social media there also came a generation of people predisposed to the nature of sharing everything with everyone and anyone without much care of who was capable of seeing this information
      and how long it would linger accessible to many such as “third-party apps, and advertisers, there is a great danger that some of the disclosures will come back to haunt people.”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a>.  Because of this a certain phenomena was studied,
      the study case being a longitudinal study of Facebook from the years 2005 to 2011 focused on a demographic of university community members which mostly consisted of students showed the 3 main phenomena of:
      “(1) the amount of personal information shared ‘publicly,’ that is, not restricted to being seen only by ‘friends’, decreased in the first few years of the study period; (2) the phenomenon reversed towards the end of the period,
      with more information being released publicly; and (3) the amount of personal information shared with friends, and with friends of friends, increased over the period.”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a> The results showed  that the normalization of social media (Facebook in this case)
      also resulted in a normalization of personal data overexposure, things you used to keep restricted to close family/friends like outings with friends or family trips are now often disclosed to many “friends” on social media with varying degrees of intimacy,
      some of these “friends” being nothing more than strangers. A more recent university study showed that as a flow on effect of this normalization of personal data overexposure there were an alarming amount of people surveyed that didn't consider looking through
      someone else's personal information via socials or just snooping through their personal devices as a true breach of privacy, able to brush it off with pretenses like mere curiosity.
      “24% of those surveyed had perpetrated ‘social insider’ attacks on people they knew well enough to gain direct access to their devices or web accounts.
      They thereby were able to access information they were not entitled to see. Reasons for perpetrating these attacks included fun, curiosity, jealousy, animosity, and utility.”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      For better or worse, in the modern world almost every aspect of daily life is documented through countless photos and videos uploaded to major social media platforms which are visible to the rest of the world.
      Unlike 20 ~ 30 years ago when an individual's mistakes & personal secrets were kept contained in the small communities (local neighborhood/school) they lived in and eventually faded over time from people's memories,
      with the advent of social media, not only is an individual able to connect with the wider populace, but the wider populace is also able to connect with the individual and view all they have shared.
      This has led to an immortalization of data over the internet as it disseminates over the world, even deleted media can be saved/recorded on the internet, making it almost impossible for something to be truly erased from the internet forever,
      this can be both a blessing as precious memories can be preserved  while also doubling up as a curse through the immortalization of mistakes, “careless actions that seem like a good idea when one is young can become embarrassing later in life.
      In the past, such actions committed in youth could not be disseminated widely. This is no longer true. Now the chances are high that we ourselves have posted these events to social media, where over a billion individuals could have seen them.”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a>
    </p>

      <h4> The Dangers of Data (Leaks & Scandals) </h4>
    <p>
      Besides the blatant encroachment on consumer privacy corporations commit by taking data outside the scope of information you willingly part with, there are 2 potentially damaging ways your collected data can be harmful to you,
      the first of these is data leaks, companies store data they collect from you somewhere, if this data happens to leak (through staff errors, phishing attempts etc.) than sensitive consumer information like financial details or
      health details can potentially be leaked to the attackers or even the general public. The second is through data scandals, a data scandal is an inappropriate misuse of data that corporations may partake in for selfish benefits like profit/political gain.
      <br>
      <br>
      An example of a notable data leak that occurred in recent years was the Twitch data leak. In October 2021, there was a leak on the streaming platform of twitch which was caused by an improperly configured server that allowed backdoor access for a malicious third party
      to gain the source code repository of twitch alongside payout data for streamers on the platform which dated from 2018 ~ 2021. It’s noted that seemingly no credentials or financial information was able to be accessed, owing to the fact that “systems that store Twitch login credentials,
      which are hashed with bcrypt, were not accessed, nor were full credit card numbers or ACH/bank information.”<a href="biblio.html">[12]</a> “Additionally, full credit card numbers are not stored by Twitch, so full credit card numbers were not exposed.” Something that Twitch was unable to determine was if the streamers
      on the platform had their “stream keys” leaked, which prompted them to reset them out of caution. Stream keys are given out to a streamer from their account on the platform, which they are then prompted to use in the recording software of their choice, the purpose of this is so the key
      can give direction on where the currently recording content should be broadcast, in this instance the recording content would be broadcast on the given streamers channel on the platform that the stream key corresponds to. This is a highly detrimental piece of information to be leaked,
      as having them available to anyone who the streamer in question doesn’t know/trust would mean they could broadcast completely unregulated or even law-breaking content (Twitch’s TOS, general censorship laws etc.) on the streamers platform,  essentially making it almost no different to having access to the account itself.
      This was a leak caused by both a technical error and a malicious third party capitalizing on it, while Twitch was luckily able to avoid this turning into a large disaster due to the various failsafes they already had in place (only storing encrypted credentials or partial financial information),
      this goes to show consumers that any corporation holding your important data is susceptible to leaks with the slightest of trip ups.
      <br>
      <br>
      Scouring the internet for a data scandal, you would be hard-pressed to find something more egregious in recent years than the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica (CA) data scandal that came to light in 2018 by newspapers “New York TImes” and “The Observer.”
      This data scandal was done with the motive of garnering support for Donald Trump’s political party in the 2016 election and was spearheaded by a company called Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm that is made up of wealthy republicans,
      notably among others one being Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Stephen Bannon. With the millions of psychographic profiles of American voters the CA built up and compiled from Facebook & voter record data,
      it was used to direct advertising campaigns and political messages in support of Donald Trump by targeting voters who the firm believed would be more in line with their/Trump’s political views,
      this was done alongside providing Trump with guidance on where he should travel in order to gain more support for his party. The Facebook/CA data scandal dates back to 2014 where: “Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University psychologist,
      was hired as a contractor by CA. He used Mechanical Turk <font color=#ff4a3d>(Amazon Crowdsourcing website)</font> to recruit 240,000 individuals to answer a battery of 100 questions to probe and understand their personality traits.
      In order to get paid a couple of dollars for their work, participants had to agree that Kogan could download from FB their demographic data and likes, friend lists, the demographic data and likes of their friends,
      and some of their private messages. He then used all this data to construct personality profiles <font color=#ff4a3d>(i.e Psychographic profiles)</font> of 87 million potential voters, combined this with voter records, and sent the results to CA.”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a>
      When information of the scandal had come to light in 2018, Mark Zuckerburg was called into congress for interrogation, where as a result of this promised that there would be major policy changes to Facebook alongside a pledge to inform the 87 million potential voters how their data was used against them to shoehorn a narrative.
