<h2>Ethics Reflections</h2>
<h3>Nemiah Hayes</h3>
<p>
  Privacy, to me, is a concern of particular importance. The more that I have researched and delved into the ideas and prospects behind data privacy and protection, the more I believe that 
  large tech companies such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft aren’t holding up to their ethical and moral responsibilities. As large tech companies who deal with vast heaps of data, they 
  have an obligation to upkeep and protect the data and personal information that they are gathering from us. Without regulation, however, it’s clearly seen particularly with the rise of social 
  media, that companies will take as much information as they can in the name of profit. When companies are able to run rampant in the way that Facebook and Google are, it’s not just a reflection 
  of those companies' wrongdoings but also on our governments for not upholding our human right to privacy. While it may seem that in a democracy like ours, that’s also a reflection of the people 
  themselves, I believe it’s seen commonly in the media that politicians themselves are, at many times, unable to fully comprehend the measures that they must take in order to protect their people. 
<br>
<br>
  It’s a tough situation to look at as when privacy isn’t being overstepped, and data isn’t being abused, there’s actually a lot of wonderful technology that has come to be very helpful in the modern 
  era behind it all. Compared to the wild west era or the internet, doing anything online is much more practical and streamlined. Thanks to technologies like device fingerprinting and cookies our 
  experiences are much more accommodated to our liking. These technologies however are very powerful, and with that power comes great responsibility. While they’re very powerful, they’re very easy to 
  abuse, and that goes especially for large companies whose websites have millions upon millions of hits on their sites every day. This also only makes the importance of regulation ever so much more 
  relevant. The morals and ethics of data collection aren’t an issue of if it should be done, it’s an issue of how it should be done.
