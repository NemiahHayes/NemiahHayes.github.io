<h2>Ethics Reflections</h2>
<h3>Nemiah Hayes</h3>
<p>
  Privacy, to me, is a concern of particular importance. The more that I have researched and delved into the ideas and prospects behind data privacy and protection, the more I believe that
  large tech companies such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft aren’t holding up to their ethical and moral responsibilities. As large tech companies who deal with vast heaps of data, they
  have an obligation to upkeep and protect the data and personal information that they are gathering from us. Without regulation, however, it’s clearly seen particularly with the rise of social
  media, that companies will take as much information as they can in the name of profit. When companies are able to run rampant in the way that Facebook and Google are, it’s not just a reflection
  of those companies' wrongdoings but also on our governments for not upholding our human right to privacy. While it may seem that in a democracy like ours, that’s also a reflection of the people
  themselves, I believe it’s seen commonly in the media that politicians themselves are, at many times, unable to fully comprehend the measures that they must take in order to protect their people.
<br>
<br>
  It’s a tough situation to look at as when privacy isn’t being overstepped, and data isn’t being abused, there’s actually a lot of wonderful technology that has come to be very helpful in the modern
  era behind it all. Compared to the wild west era or the internet, doing anything online is much more practical and streamlined. Thanks to technologies like device fingerprinting and cookies our
  experiences are much more accommodated to our liking. These technologies however are very powerful, and with that power comes great responsibility. While they’re very powerful, they’re very easy to
  abuse, and that goes especially for large companies whose websites have millions upon millions of hits on their sites every day. This also only makes the importance of regulation ever so much more
  relevant. The morals and ethics of data collection aren’t an issue of if it should be done, it’s an issue of how it should be done.

<p>
  Modern society has given immense power to information, from the lesser evils of advertisers and marketing companies which profit off of user information by catering
  products/services to people based on what their profiling has suggested the user would like, to the dangerous psychological manipulation that is rampant throughout
  social media with manipulated narratives that pigeonhole people into deceptive influences, as evident by the tampering of the 2016 election where data (Facebook/CA Scandal)
  was wielded to nudge voters into siding with Donald Trump's republican party or how authoritative entities like the Department of Homeland Security have mentioned that they will
  “collect social media data on all immigrants, all green card holders, and all naturalized citizens”<a href="biblio.html">[1]</a> in the name of “security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy is a human right, yet looking at the world of today where corporations know no boundaries in the lengths they go to get your personal information for profitable gain it would be hard to imagine it as a fundamental right given to humans,
  especially when considering governments and other authorities usually play a hand in this information gathering themselves. There aren’t many people that would be happy to know that the majority of their lives are being probed constantly
  in the supposed safe havens of their home, something that can evidently be seen when it was leaked to the general public of America by former NSA (National Security Agency) contractor “Edward Snowden” in 2013 that the NSA
  was collecting and monitoring the phone calls of the citizens. A study showed that more than 71% of individuals were strongly against the idea of their online activities being surveilled by large corporations/government entities<a href="biblio.html">[17]</a>,
  I agree with the stance that the majority has taken as these large corporations/governments have seeped far too much into the personal lives of the average citizen, to the level of knowing them better than the people know themselves,
  but have personally taken an apathetic stance against the fight for my privacy as I don’t think it's realistically possible for us to return back to the times of keeping our information to ourselves in contrast to the amount of advantages
  it provides to companies or governments which have enough incentive to consistently step on our human right to privacy.
